- **Testing & QA**: 15% (accessibility, performance, code quality)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Buffer Time**: Add 20% buffer to each phase estimate
- **Dependency Issues**: Keep fallback plans for complex dependencies
- **Performance Issues**: Profile early, optimize incrementally
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined requirements, document future enhancements
